# üåø Dataset for Integrating Seaweed Biostimulant and UAV-Based Sensing for Precision Drought Management in Groundnut

This repository contains all datasets and R scripts used in the study:  
**"Integrating Seaweed Biostimulant and UAV-Based Sensing for Precision Drought Management in Groundnut"**

The project combines field-collected agronomic and physiological data with UAV-derived remote sensing indices to assess and model drought stress in groundnut cultivation under bio-stimulant treatment.
